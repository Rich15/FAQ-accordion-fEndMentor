### Useful resources

- [A complete guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This article is really useful to have all Flexbox properties on hand.
- [Overlapping three elements](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26644163/how-to-make-3-elements-overlap-each-other-with-css) - This Stack Overflow post gave me the idea to use the fake backgrounds to make the images overlap each other.
- [How to create an accordion](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_accordion.asp) - This w3 Schools tutorial helped me to end the accordion when I was stucked. It also helped to understand class toggling with Javascript.
